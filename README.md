This is my first Nextjs project. In this project, I tried to clone an existing project by rewriting its code myself. 

My priorities in this project were to work with APIs and learn to use Nextauth(Sign in with Google). I also connected a database with MongoDb and added options such as register and login from within the site.

As I set out to learn Nextjs as a minus part of the project, I did not attach enough importance to the CSS side and did not create a responsive website.
